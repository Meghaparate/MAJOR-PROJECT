      "No Relinquishment of Tenancy in the Present Case\n",
      "The appellant, W.H. King, was the tenant of a flat and allegedly demanded a sum of money from the complainant for vacating the flat. The complainant reported the matter to the police, and a trap was laid for the appellant. The police recovered a sum of money and various documents from the appellant and the complainant. The list of documents includes a typed draft of a partnership agreement, an application form for permission to occupy the building as caretaker, a letter handing vacant possession, a receipt for payment for articles of furniture, and a letter to the Bombay Gas Company for transfer of the gas connection. The appellant was charged under section 18(1) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, LVII of 1947, for receiving a pugree of Rs. 29,500 and he was further charged under section 19(2) of the said Act for receiving the said sum as a condition for the relinquishment of his tenancy. The defence of the appellant was that he was in search of a partner to carry on his business during his intended absence, who was also to act as caretaker of his flat and that it was in this connection and with this object in view that he entered into negotiations with the complainant. The sum of Rs. 29,500 was not pugree but represented capital for 0 12 0 share in the business and as the complainant was also to be a caretaker of the flat, the sum of Rs. 2,000 was paid and received as a guarantee against disposal and damage of the furniture and it was agreed to be paid back on the appellant's return to India. The wife of the appellant denied any aiding and abetting. The Presidency Magistrate, who tried the case, disbelieved the defence on the facts, holding that what was received by the accused was by way of pugree. As section 18 (1) of the Act was not applicable he convicted him under section 19(2) of the Act and sentenced him, in view of his old age and blindness, to one day's simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 30,000. The wife was acquitted, the evidence being insufficient to prove any abetment. The appellant preferred an appeal to the High Court of Bombay but it was summarily dismissed on 20 2 1950. He asked for a certificate under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution but this was rejected on 10 4 1950. Thereafter he applied for special leave to appeal to this Court and it was granted on 3 10 1950. A short legal argument was advanced on behalf of the appellant based on the language of section 19 (1) of the Act and this is the only point which requires our consideration. The section which consists of two parts is in these terms: \"(1) It shall not be lawful for the tenant or any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of the tenant to claim or receive any sum or any consideration as a condition for the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises; 422 (2) Any tenant or person who in contravention of the provisions of sub section (1) receives any sum or consideration shall, on conviction, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months and shall also be punished with fine which shall not be less than the sum or the value of the consideration received by him.\" It was urged that the offence arises only on receipt of any sum or any consideration as a condition of the relinquishment by a tenant of his tenancy and that in the present case there was no such relinquishment. Exhibit D, which is the most material document, under which the appellant handed over vacant possession of the flat to the complainant, constitutes or evidences an assignment of the tenancy and not a relinquishment. The document is a letter of relinquishment of a flat and garage by W.H. King to Mr. Mulchand Kodumal Bhatia. The appellant argued that the word \"relinquishment\" should have a limited meaning and that the word \"surrender\" would have been more appropriate. The court held that the distinction between an assignment and relinquishment or surrender is too plain to be ignored. In the case of an assignment, the assignor continues to be liable to the landlord for the performance of his obligations under the tenancy and this liability is contractual, while the assignee becomes liable by reason of privity of estate. The consent of the landlord to an assignment is not necessary, in the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary. But in the case of relinquishment, it cannot be a unilateral transaction; it can only be in favour of the lessor by mutual agreement between them. The relinqu\n"
